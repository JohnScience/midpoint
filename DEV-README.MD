At the time of writing, `midpoint` offers only implementations for primitive integers.

In order to implement midpoint function for [primitive IEEE 754 floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754), it would be great to first develop a dedicated IEEE 754 package.

Before that, however, it would be great to have a package for [interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic).
